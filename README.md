Phase 5 Capstone Project: Newsletter Generator

For my capstone project I wanted to build an app that was unique and functional, so I started thinking about the ways that I use technology and what could be improved. Something that immediately came to mind that could use improvement is the built-in reading list of our web browsers.

Forget Me Not is a React/Rails web application that allows you to save articles to a custom reading list and receive them in an email newsletter. You choose when you want to read them: that week or by the end of the month.

The web application has a built-in form to enter the URL of the article you want to save. It was built to be used with a Chrome extension which you will see in the demo, but it doesn't currently work with the heroku deployed app.

From the web app the user can view their Reading List and Newsletter. The Reading List shows all of the articles that the user has saved to any newsletter and you can see the expected send date of the newsletter containing that article. The Newsletter is selected by frequency. In future versions this will send a newsletter automatically to you at the appropriate time either at the end of the week or the end of the month and you can see the expected date where when you will receive a specific article over here in your reading list. Currently you can send the email by clicking the button on the newsletter page.
